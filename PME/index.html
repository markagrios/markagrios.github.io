	My name is <a class="links">Gregory Taylor</a>, and I am the current president of Pi Mu Epsilon, an honor society for undergraduates interested in Mathematics. We are recruiting new members this semester! The benefits of joining PME include
	1) Weekly (non-mandatory) meetings to build connections with other students in the department and learn from them,
	2) Travel grants to conferences
	3) A nice talking point on your CV/Resume
	Our chapter of PME meets every Monday at 6 pm. During these meetings, we have free food(!), talks from students and faculty on various mathematical topics, and unstructured time to enjoy the company of people with similar academic interests. In the past, we have also held reading groups on topics which are not usually covered in courses at W&M (differential topology, non-linear PDE, algebraic graph theory, etc.).
	The requirements to join are as follows:
	1) Have taken (or be enrolled in) 2 mathematics classes numbered 200 or higher
	2) 3.0 overall GPA through Fall 2016
	3) 3.0 GPA in mathematics courses through Fall 2016.
	Interested? Email me (Greg Taylor at gktaylor@email.wm.edu) and Anke Van Zuylen (anke@wm.edu) to express interest, and we will get you set up for inductions. All you have to do is email!
	I look forward to seeing you all at inductions.
