			<p class="content">
			Hey! I'm Mark! I'm a senior in high school interested in everything I don't already know. 
			Most of my curiousity lies within the realm of sciences and math rather than the arts
			but I love it all just the same. I've been involved in my high school's TSA (Technology
			Students Association) chapter for four years and was vice president my junior year. I have also
			spent my four years of high school on the robotics team being co-captain the last three years.
			In middle school at around the time I learned to ride a unicycle, I picked up the art of performing magic. Since then
			I have explored and created many of my own illusions and have performed on the streets of Washington
			D.C. doing tricks with everyday items and hypnotizing spectators. I've always been interested 
			in music. I appreciate the structure and complexities that lie within a piece of music 
			and I like taking apart movements and see what makes certain parts so enjoyable. The only 
			visual art media I am somewhat involved in is photography. I enjoy exploring with light and 
			contrast so black and white prints (especially of nature) I often find intriguing.
			</p>
		<a class="contentheader">What I love.</a>
			<p class="content">Everything</p>
		<a class="contentheader">What I do.</a>
			<p class="content">
			Quite a lot, I believe. My curiosity with information has led to the robots we used in our 
			competitions to sort through different colored balls using camera interpolation. Most of
			what I do in the field of computers focus on certain concepts such as color identification, 
			infinite sequences, or the random map generator on <a id="cabreralink" href="https://www.cabrera.io/conquest" target="_blank">cabrera.io</a>
			(in progress, press "R" to load a new map) as opposed to practically developed computer applications. My fascination with 
			music lead to me teaching myself how to read music and basic music theory after I already 
			taught myself to play the basics on piano, guitar, bass, and ukulele. I'm currently in the 
			process of learning Korean which is very nice to take a break from the western cyrillic 
			alphabet. It is interesting to see what vowels and consonants different spoken languages 
			have that others do not. My love for things dexterous and physics makes my unicycle-riding
			more fun than it should be. It is hard for me even to comprehend what and how my brain 
			communicates with my muscles as I balance on a single point on a plane with most of the 
			weight relatively high. It's the mix of brain functions and physics and skill that makes not 
			only riding a unicycle fun but also thinking about it. This website is an effort to mix 
			functionality with aesthetics which is one of the more enjoyable wars I've fought in my 
			lifelong journey. I believe most of my inspiration for my design and layout comes from my love 
			of subtle class found in simple but not minimal design.
