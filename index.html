		About me.
		</p>
		<p>
		As a student from Washington D.C. I've found numerous places to fuel my never ending curiosity from building 
		robots to unicycling to performing magic on the streets. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I love building robots. I've been involved with my high school's robotics team being 
		co-captain three years and president my senior year. We compete in <a class="links" href="http://www.botball.org/">Botball</a> 
		and <a class="links" href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc">FTC</a> and have won awards and honors 
		for my code using color camera interpolation and infrared orientation. I have also been a member of my school 
		TSA (Technology Students Association) chapter for four years and was vice-president my junior year. We won second 
		place for the animatronics event for the state of Virginia my first two years. My friends and I also compete in ctf's 
		(capture the flag) which are information security competitions where students compete to find keys and break codes.
		Most of my contributions to the team involve the math behind cryptography in order to break keys or restore lost information, 
		but I can get away with a few networking challenges here and there. I'm also very interested in mixing my knowledge  
		of computers and science with the world around me. I created a random map <a class="links" href="http://cabrera.io/conquest/">generator</a> 
		for a game my friend and I made (press 'R' to load a new map). Before I actually coded it, I spent a while reseaching how 
		techtonic plates move and how landmasses form to get a more organic looking map to be generated.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm interested in almost everything. I love reading novels by F. Scott Fitzgerald just as much as I do exploring 
		concepts of mathematics in my spare time. I hold regional/state awards in both mixed media art and code written for our robots in competition. I can play some coherent tunes on the guitar, bass, ukulele and piano and 
		even taught myself to read music. After my years of taking Spanish in highschool, I decided I was bored in the western 
		latin alphabet and endeavored to learn Korean, which seems to be going well. I can ride a unicycle and I can't count 
		how many times I've been asked if it is twice as hard as riding a bike..
		</p>
		<p>
		As fascinated as I am with computers and science and math, I am also a performing magician and hypnotist. I have 
		always loved interacting with people and having a way of doing that where I also entertain as well as learn makes 
		magic something I enjoy very much. I started with a deck of cards when I was in seventh grade and have since then 
		moved on to other fields of magic such as mentalism and large stage illusions and have even created and published 
		some of my own.

			<div id="page-design" class="page">
			<p>
			This website is the product of my fascination of both aesthetics and function. My interest in simple design, 
			typography, and contrast has lead the design of this website to the place it is now. The animations and layout 
			utilize certain principles of psychology and mathematics to make the design appealing. See if you can find the 
			golden ratio in the spacing of certain elements ;D. Also, you might notice how most of the animations I made have 
			small changes in opacity somewhere in them which plays on the brain's response to something seeming to appear rather 
			than something changing that was already there.

			<div id="topic-hatemath" class="topics shift"><a>Why do people hate math?</a></div>
			<div id="page-hatemath" class="page">
			<p>
			Mathematics seems to be the only subject that is socially acceptable to openly deplore. I understand that some 
			people might not be very good at it or don't understand it fully or just aren't interested. However, I believe 
			what we (dorks) need to make known to people is that the world of mathematics is a beautiful and wonderul place 
			not bounded by rules and formulas like what most people think. Scientists will say math is a tool while mathematicians 
			say it is a science and an art by itself. Both labels are equally valid but that does not stop a large proportion 
			of people from despising it in practice. People see that great achievements of scientists and artists and wonder 
			how amazing they are but a minute amount of people have ever wondered what tools the Wright brothers used to build 
			their flying machine or what paintbrush Michelangelo used to paint the Sistine Chapel. 
			</p>
			<p>
			From what I have seen, 
			math is taught in a seemingly backwards style. Most subjects are taught and, to make them relatable, some background 
			is given to let the students understand why it is important. In some way, foreground must be given to students taking 
			math in order for it to seem relevant. Students are taught the different ways and approaches to solving problems 
			but are almost never shown what these theorems and principles can lead to down the road.
