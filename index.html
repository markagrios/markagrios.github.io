			<p class="header">About &mdash;</p>
			<p class="content">
				Hi I'm Mark.
			</p>
			<p class="content">
				As a student from Washington DC, I've found plenty of ways to fuel my infinite curiosity. From graphic design to 
				building robots to performing magic on the streets, I love learning and doing things that make me think. 
			</p>
			<p class="content">
				My first fascination I became truly engrossed in was computer programming which I'm still very active in. I coded 
				infrared navigation and color camera interpolation for my highschool robotics team and continue to have various 
				projects going on (check out my projects). I picked up web designing my senior year of highschool and made this 
				website to battle the never ending struggle of aesthetics versus function. 
			</p>
			<p class="content">
				I'm a math and science dork (I'll never be able to escape that, even if I wanted to) but I run my little design 
				business and read just as many F. Scott Fitzgerald books as I do journals on math and biology. My very first job 
				was being a designer at a small tech company where I remade their website and worked with an actual designer to 
				give the company a consistent visual appearence to their clients (I got to pick the company's official font). I 
				am now cursed with having to walk around everywhere making note of the fonts on every street sign, menu, and flyer 
				I come across.
			</p>
			<p class="content">
				Overall, I just love learning things. I can incorporate the math and psychology I learn in class into the designs 
				I make for people and can relate my fascination with words and color to the research I do at school. The world is 
				too big for me to pick "science" or "art" so I decided to play with both.
			</p>

		<div id="projects-content" class="topic">
			<p class="header">Projects &mdash;</p>
			<p class="content">
				I'm always working on (or at least thinking about) something, so the projects I'm able to share I'll put up here.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p class="content">
				<a class="title wordlinks" href="http://pushbuddy.me">PushBuddy</a> &mdash;
				<br><br>
				My freshman year of highschool, my friends and I competed in VT Hacks III and won second place for our hack. We 
				wanted to tackle the confusion and frustration that comes with all the different cloud storage services out there 
				and PushBuddy was born. I designed the website :D
			</p>
			
			<p class="content">
				<a class="title wordlinks" href="https://github.com/markagrios/letoli">LeToLi</a> &mdash; 
				<br><br>
				<u>Le</u>arn <u>To</u> <u>Li</u>ve is a rather large project I'm working on. My fascination with neursoscience 
				and mathematics has lead me to start constructing a learning neural network. I built a simulation world and put 
				and organism in it that knows how to move, eat, drink, and sleep and has different stats for each. Once I'm 
				done I'll put it on its own website where anyone can check in on him to watch him live, die, and learn from his 
				mistakes.
			</p>
			<p class="content">
				I'm using stochastic gradient descent to find global minima and continuous threshold biased neurons. I'm trying 
				to model LeToLi's learning after a single organisms brain solving local problems not genetic algorithms that model 
				the adaptations of a species like other machine learning programs.
			</p>
			
			<p class="content">
				<a class="title wordlinks" href="docs/districtsans.png">District Sans</a> &mdash; 
				<br><br>
				Now that I'm able to actually call myself as a "designer", it's about time for me to design my own typeface.
				District Sans is my current attempt to create a humanist sans serif typeface that can be used for large bodies 
				of text. I'm not even close to done, but here's a little preview to what I have so far.

			<p class="header">Hi! &mdash;</p>
			<p class="content">
				I love meeting new people, chances are if you're here I know you personally. But if I don't, send me an email at 
				magrios@gmail.com.
			</p>
			<p class="content">
				I run a little design business because I love designing logos and prints for people. So if you are starting a business 
				or project and need a logo or you need printed things like wedding invitations or business cards, head over to 
				<a class="wordlinks" href="http://diglosdesign.com">diglosdesign.com</a> to take a look at some pieces I've made in the 
				past.
