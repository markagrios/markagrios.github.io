			<p class="content">
			Hey! I'm Mark! I'm a senior in high school interested in everything I don't already know. 
			Most of my curiousity lies within the realm of sciences and math rather than the arts
			but I love it all just the same. I've been involved in my high school's TSA (Technology
			Students Association) chapter for four years and was vice president my junior year. I have also
			spent my four years of high school on the robotics team being co-captain the last three years.
			In middle school at around the time I learned to ride a unicycle, I picked up the art of performing magic. Since then
			I have explored and created many of my own illusions and have performed on the streets of Washington
			D.C. doing tricks with everyday items and hypnotizing spectators. I've always been interested 
			in music. I appreciate the structure and complexities that lie within a piece of music 
			and I like taking apart movements and see what makes certain parts so enjoyable. The only 
			visual art media I am somewhat involved in is photography. I enjoy exploring with light and 
			contrast so black and white prints (especially of nature) I often find intriguing. However, 
			more than music and photography, I find language the most amazing. With my practice in the art
			of hypnotism, I have come to appreciate the small facets of meaning we can put into spoken
			language. The deep ambiguity of speech only seems ambiguous because of the lack of conscious
			thought we put into it. I find this truly astounding.
			</p>
		<a class="contentheader">What I love.</a>
			<p class="content">Everything</p>
		<a class="contentheader">What I do.</a>
			<p class="content">
			Quite a lot, I believe. My curiosity with information has led to the robots we used in our 
			competitions to sort through different colored balls using camera interpolation. Most of
			what I do in the field of computers focuses on certain concepts such as color identification, 
			infinite sequences, or the random map generator on <a id="cabreralink" href="https://www.cabrera.io/conquest" target="_blank">cabrera.io</a>
			(in progress) as opposed to practically developed computer applications. My fascination with 
			music lead to me teaching myself how to read music and basic music theory after I already 
			taught myself to play the basics on piano, guitar, bass, and ukulele. I'm currently in the 
			process of learning Korean which is very nice to take a break from the western cyrillic 
			alphabet. It is interesting to see what vowels and consonants different spoken languages 
			have that others do not. My love for things dexterous and physics makes my unicycle-riding
			more fun than it should be. It is hard for me even to comprehend what and how my brain 
			communicates with my muscles as I balance on a single point on a plane with most of the 
			weight relatively high. It's the mix of brain functions and physics and skill that makes not 
			only riding a unicycle fun but also thinking about it. This website is an effort to mix 
			functionality with aesthetics which is one of the more enjoyable wars I've fought in my 
			lifelong journey. I believe most of my inspiration for my design and layout comes from my love 
			for the color red (darkish deep red specifically) and subtle class found in simple but not 
			minimal design. If you're wondering, the hex value of this red I use is #870B0B.

							<p class="pagecontent">
							The title of this page uses the words "thoughts" but an extra 'u.' I did this 
							to try to point out how much that letter actually contributes to the word 
							because what sound does the u add to the already shot 'o' sound? Did 
							you pronounce it differently in your head? Did you even notice it? I've always 
							been fascinated with information but here I want to talk about the less science-y 
							side of it.

						<div id="hatemath">
						<p class="pagetitle">Why do some people hate math?</p>
							<p class="pagecontent">
							Most people actually don't hate mathematics because they do not know exactly 
							what mathematics is or rather what it can be. People are taught in school about 
							how rote and concrete math is and you cannot stray from the rules. I have to 
							say that this is untrue. What people learn in school is applied mathematics, it 
							is the model of how this and function in the world we live in when the entirety 
							of mathematics truly much large and much more beautiful.
							</p>
							<p class="pagecontent">
							The biggest obstacle that people face with math is mistaking its function for 
							its purpose. The true function of math that we see is to explain the world around 
							us in a concrete way. Its purpose is actually much more magnificent because of 
							its simplicity. Mathematics is its own entity, it is a formal system of which 
							certain truths are accepted and the rest is all interpretation from there. The 
							reason mathematics is taught is for its function, it is a tool. The thing people 
							don't appreciate about mathematics is that they see it as only a tool. There has 
							never been a person who looked at the Wright brothers' flying machine and glorified 
							the tools used to build it, nor looked at Picasso's art and pay any attention 
							to the paintbrushes he used.So when someone says the hate mathematics they are really saying that they have 
							failed to understand the potential of the tools they were given.
							</p>
							<p class="pagetitle">What could one stop "hating" math?</p>
							<p class="pagecontent">
							This problem should be addressed really in two ways. There are people that dislike 
							the idea of all the rules and do not find value in the function and purpose of 
							math and other are simply just "bad" at math and that is why they hate it. "Bad" 
							is not the best word to be used here, many people how are "bad" at math simply 
							had trouble grasping the abstract concepts of what they were taught or just enjoyed 
							other subject more in their schooling career. Again, math is a tool and that 
							function is taught at an early age. Children first learn to count and then add 
							and then multiply etc. They people who dislike math, most likely, never stepped 
							past the question of "what more can math do besides explain what's around me?" 
							That is a perfectly rational notion to entertain, when given an object, oh say, 
							an iPhone, people new to this object often have the question of "what else can 
							it do?" Mathematics is the same way, people who do not follow their natural 
							curiosity of pursuing something's potential, no matter how abstract 
							or concrete it may be, are often the ones who end up with a distaste for mathematics.
							</p>
							<p class="pagetitle">What kind of people are mathematicians?</p>
							<p class="pagecontent">
							Many people find mathematicians and scientists the most concrete and unimaginative 
							people. This does have some truth in it, but, the people who find no interest in 
							math and science are often very rational. They didn't look at the line 1+1=2 and 
							ask why, they accepted it for what the world agreed on and continued. This is not 
							at all a bad thing, people have different interests and ideas. The idea of mathematics 
							beyond what most people see it as is a very amorphous concept and generally people 
							who find interest in the real world seem to sway in the opposite direction as 
							math and more towards science, music, art, literature, because they find more 
							value in the finished product rather than the tools.
