		About me.
		</p>
		<p>
		As a student from Washington D.C. I've found numerous places to fuel my never ending curiosity from building 
		robots to unicycling to performing magic on the streets. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I love learning things, figuring out new and different ways of thinking about various subjects. Since there is no 
		conceivable way for me to learn everything I want to in my short life on this earth, I figured I would just try 
		to end each day knowing more about myself or the world more than I did the previous day. 
		</p>
		<p>
		My curiosity has taken me to wildly different places, the first topic I became truly engrossed in was computer 
		coding which I am still very active in. In highschool, I got involved with my school's robotics team where we would build and 
		program robots to do certain tasks. We competed in <a class="links" href="http://www.botball.org/">Botball</a> 
		and <a class="links" href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc">FTC</a> and have won awards and honors 
		for my code using color camera interpolation and infrared orientation. I was also a member of my school 
		<a class="links" href="http://www.tsaweb.org/">TSA</a> (<u>T</u>echnology <u>S</u>tudents <u>A</u>ssociation) chapter for four years and was vice-president my junior year. We won second 
		place for the animatronics event for the state of Virginia my first two years. My friends and I also compete in ctf's 
		(capture the flag) which are information security competitions where students compete to find keys and break codes.
		Starting at the end of my highschool career, my team and I have been going to <a class="links" href="https://mlh.io/about">hackathons</a> 
		where we won second place out of 56 teams at VT Hacks III for our project <a class="links" href="pushbuddy.me">PushBuddy</a>.
		As I have gotten better and computer programming, 
		I taught myself all the tools to make a website because I think that here is where I can attempt to solve the never-ending struggle of  
		aesthetics versus function. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm a math and science dork, I'll never be able to escape that even if I wanted to. However, I'll spend almost as 
		much time reading my through my stacks of F. Scott Fitzgerald books as I do reading through Wikipedia articles on 
		math and biology. I'm always reading or at least thinking about something that will change or challenge my understanding 
		of myself or the world I live in. With all the research and projects I work on that are math/science related, I base 
		a lot of my creativity from the art forms I've been exposed to because I feel that a paragraph, a painting, a song 
		can do just as much for us as a groundbreaking piece of technology, especially in this day and age.
		</p>
		<p>
		Overall, I just truly enjoy learning things and doing something with what I have learned. Impulsively deciding to 
		learn to ride a unicycle was a great decision because.....now I can ride a unicycle. Seeing a magician perform when 
		was younger pushed me to learn magic which later became a huge part of my life and now I am a performing street 
		magician and hypnotist. In this world we live in, you can do anything. Make a website for yourself just for fun, 
		start a clothing design business with your brother, learn anything you want to with a rectangle that fits in your hand. 
		I see all these amazing things that people do and there is absolutely nothing stopping me from doing them too, so 
		I join them.

			<p>
			This website is the product of my fascination of both aesthetics and function. My interest in simple design, 
			typography, and contrast has lead the design of this website to the place it is now. The animations and layout 
			utilize certain principles of psychology and mathematics to make the design appealing. See if you can find the 
			golden ratio in the spacing of certain elements ;D. Also, you might notice how most of the animations I made have 
			small changes in opacity somewhere in them which plays on the brain's response to something seeming to appear rather 
			than something changing that was already there.

			<div id="topic-hatemath" class="topics shift"><a>Why do people hate math?</a></div>
			<div id="page-hatemath" class="page">
			<p>
			Mathematics seems to be the only subject that is socially acceptable to openly deplore. I understand that some 
			people might not be very good at it or don't understand it fully or just aren't interested. However, I believe 
			what we (those who enjoy math) need to make known to people is that the world of mathematics is a beautiful and wonderul place 
			not bounded by rules and formulas like what most people think. Scientists will say math is a tool while mathematicians 
			say it is a science and an art by itself. Both labels are equally valid but that does not stop a large proportion 
			of people from despising it in practice. People see that great achievements of scientists and artists and wonder 
			how amazing they are but a minute amount of people have ever wondered what tools the Wright brothers used to build 
			their flying machine or what paintbrush Michelangelo used to paint the Sistine Chapel. 
			</p>
			<p>
			From what I have seen, 
			math is taught in a seemingly backwards style. Most subjects are taught and, to make them relatable, some background 
			is given to let the students understand why it is important. In some way, foreground must be given to students taking 
			math in order for it to seem relevant. Students are taught the different ways and approaches to solving problems 
			but are almost never shown what these theorems and principles can lead to down the road. Displaying pi as an 
			infinite rational expression or extrapolating the factorial function to all real numbers are a beautiful example 
			of pure mathematics in practice. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Thinking of a moment where you used the math you learned in first grade is not hard. Trying to find a time you 
			needed to factor a seventh degree polynomial for some reason is a bit trickier. Math builds on itself, not that 
			other subjects do not, but most people find that the fundamentals of math are simply the only ones they need while 
			most other areas, the most advanced and complex disciplines are the most appealing, think music and art. This, I 
			believe, is the pitfall that many people fall into. You go through school learning more and more about subjects 
			that interest you and you get to understand why they are important to the world and why you personally might 
			find them fascinating. Mathematics seems to lose many people because it gets arbitrarily complicated as it progresses 
			fading away from people's lists of "relevant" topics. If nothing else, I want people to look at mathematics the same way
			they look at other fields of art and science. To appreciate it as its own field of study that has everything music and 
			science and language and everything has, not this alien clutter of obnoxiously cryptic symbols that explain irrelevant 
			things I'll never use in life. So, whether you like mathematics or not, take a moment to 
			look into it next time you come across it and try to find its simple elegance in logic that is so applicable to the 
			real world.

			<div id="topic-geography" class="topics shift"><a>Geography (in progress)</a></div>
			<div id="page-geography" class="page">
			<p>
			I took an introductory geography class my first semester in college because I needed to fill a slot and it 
			seemed like it would be easy enough. I, like most people, thought geography was about the locations of cities 
			and landmarks on a map. It's not.
			</p>
			<p>
			I quickly learned through the help of my amazing professor that geography is more than just locations but what 
			they mean and why they're there.

		Projects
		</p>
		<p>
		This is where I'll post my projects, as sparse and unfinished as they might be, you can get an idea as to what I'm interested in.
		</p>
		<p><a class="links" href="http://cabrera.io/conquest/">Map Generator</a> (press 'R' to load a new map)</p>
		<p>
		This is a random map generator I made for a game my friend and I were working with but never took off. It randomly 
		assigns certain cells to different terrains to start with and then uses a recursive algorithm to expand outward from 
		there. I tried to model its behavior after real techtonic plate movements so I attempted to add some pseudo-entropy 
		at the expense of run time.
		</p>
		<p><a class="links" href="/dice">DICE</a></p>
		<p>
		<u>Di</u>gital <u>C</u>orrection <u>E</u>ngine, or DICE, is a current project of mine to explore image and data 
		analysis with correction algorithms. Right now it can't do much but in the future it should be able to straighten 
		lines and smooth out curves you draw with your mouse.
		</p>
		

		<p><a class="links" href="http://www.pushbuddy.me">PushBuddy</a></p>
		<p>
		PushBuddy is a simple desktop program to make cloud synchronizing much easier. It synchronizes your Dropbox, Google 
		Drive, and other cloud services (eventually) to your local file system so managing your files becomes simple and 
		automatic. It won second place out of 56 teams at Virginia Tech's third annual hackathon in the Spring of 2016 and is 
		now being funded by George Mason University to be launched as a product.
		</p>		
		
		<p><a class="links" href="https://github.com/markagrios/letoli">LeToLi</a> (basically my life's work)</p>
		<p>
		Letoli is an organism that <u>Le</u>arns <u>To</u> <u>Li</u>ve in his environment using a neural network that 
		uses my own approach of machine learning closely related to how the human brain operates to discover new ways 
		to most efficiently cope with the world around him. He has different 
		stats for his food, water, and sleep that effect his health and are used as inputs that will determine his 
		actions: move, eat, drink, or sleep. Different attempts at living will let Letoli rethink how he acts when one of 
		his stats are low.
		</p>
		<p>
		This is still a project in progress. Once the program is complete enough, the link will direct to a website where 
		Letoli is constantly trying different ways to live which will be running continuously for anyone who wants to check 
		in on him.
