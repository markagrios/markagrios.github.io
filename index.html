			<p class="content">
			Hey! I'm Mark! I'm a senior in high school interested in everything I don't already know. 
			Most of my curiousity lies within the realm of sciences and math rather than the arts
			but I love it all just the same. I've been involved in my high school's TSA (Technology
			Students Association) chapter for four years and was vice president my junior year. I have also
			spent my four years of high school on the robotics team being co-captain the last three years.
			In middle school at around the time I learned to ride a unicycle, I picked up the art of performing magic. Since then
			I have explored and created many of my own illusions and have performed on the streets of Washington
			D.C. doing tricks with everyday items and hypnotizing spectators. I've always been interested 
			in music. I appreciate the structure and complexities that lie within a piece of music 
			and I like taking apart movements and see what makes certain parts so enjoyable. The only 
			visual art media I am somewhat involved in is photography. I enjoy exploring with light and 
			contrast so black and white prints (especially of nature) I often find intriguing. However, 
			more than music and photography, I find language the most amazing. With my practice in the art
			of hypnotism, I have come to appreciate the small facets of meaning we can put into spoken
			language. The deep ambiguity of speech only seems ambiguous because of the lack of conscious
			thought we put into it. I find this truly astounding.
			</p>
		<a class="contentheader">What I love.</a>
			<p class="content">Everything</p>
		<a class="contentheader">What I do.</a>
			<p class="content">
			Quite a lot, I believe. My curiosity with information has led to the robots we used in our 
			competitions to sort through different colored balls using camera interpolation. Most of
			what I do in the field of computers focuses on certain concepts such as color identification, 
			infinite sequences, or the random map generator on <a id="cabreralink" href="https://www.cabrera.io/conquest" target="_blank">cabrera.io</a>
			(in progress) as opposed to practically developed computer applications. My fascination with 
			music lead to me teaching myself how to read music and basic music theory after I already 
			taught myself to play the basics on piano, guitar, bass, and ukulele. I'm currently in the 
			process of learning Korean which is very nice to take a break from the western cyrillic 
			alphabet. It is interesting to see what vowels and consonants different spoken languages 
			have that others do not. My love for things dexterous and physics makes my unicycle-riding
			more fun than it should be. It is hard for me even to comprehend what and how my brain 
			communicates with my muscles as I balance on a single point on a plane with most of the 
			weight relatively high. It's the mix of brain functions and physics and skill that makes not 
			only riding a unicycle fun but also thinking about it. This website is an effort to mix 
			functionality with aesthetics which is one of the more enjoyable wars I've fought in my 
			lifelong journey. I believe most of my inspiration for my design and layout comes from my love 
			for the color red (darkish deep red specifically) and subtle class found in simple but not 
			minimal design. If you're wondering, the hex value of this red I use is #870B0B.

						<div id="hatemath">
						<p class="pagetitle">Why do some people hate math?</p>
							<p class="pagecontent">
							People love learning. Some people will say they don't because they associate it 
							with school but people do indeed love to learn. A majority of what people enjoy 
							learning is the world around them and how it works. Mathematics is a tool. No 
							one appreciates tools. People will look at the very first airplane and find it 
							truly amazing, man conquering the ancient dream of flight. How many people stop 
							and think about what tools the Wright brothers used to construct their flying 
							machine?
							</p>
							<p class="pagecontent">
							People don't like being told what to do. Many will say rules are meant to be 
							broken. It is driven too deep into people's head that you can never break the 
							rules of math. This is the biggest deal breaker for people learning mathematics. 
							People go through school learning about the controversial art movements of Monet 
							or the disputed works of Voltaire. People learn how often change must take place 
							in order for any progress to be made. People also learn how you must always do 
							math this very specific way if you want the right answers. We are not taught, 
							however, how much mathematics has changed since its beginnings. The ancient 
							Greeks believed only in rational numbers, number that can be expressed as a 
							ratio of two integers (-1/2, 10, 54/11). The square root of 2 is not rational. 
							It is very easy to constuct, take to lines of length 1 and form a right angle, 
							the length between the two endpoints not touching is the square root of 2. 
							Similarly, the square root of -1 is a bit harder to grasp. Take a number line 
							from negative infinity to positive infinity, any "real" number will be on that 
							line, I could have 2 eggs, the ratio of the circle's perimeter to its diameter 
							is pi which is to the right of 3, I can be $1000 in debt which is far to the 
							left of 0. The square root of -1 will not be on that line. When people discovered 
							these "numbers that can't exist" the threw them out, they said "we can't use 
							these, they make no sense." Imagine going through art school painting pictures 
							of fruit, and one day you decided to paint a  picture of your friend deeply 
							focused on his painting of fruit. Your first question when your teacher tells 
							you "all of art is about painting fruit" would be "why?" People looked up at the 
							sky and saw birds and thought that man should someday fly. Lots of the world 
							said "no, man doesn't fly, birds fly, but not man."
							</p>
							<p class="pagecontent">
							Every concept has rules. If I drop this bowl of noodles, it will fall and smash. 
							Gravity is relatively easy so grasp. However, rules only apply to what follows 
							them. This is probably the most counter-intuitive idea I've discovered, it's 
							bizarrely backwards. There is no universal space called "rules" that everything 
							in the universe fits in; there are pockets of rules that each have a set of things 
							they apply to and each pocket of rules is different. A simple rule in mathematics 
							is that if you square a number you will always have a positive result. When the 
							idea of the number 'i' was accepted the idea that it didn't play by that rule 
							was also accepted.  
							</p>
							<p class="pagecontent">
							When people say the hate math, most of the time they are saying the hate all 
							the rules math has. They are not taught the beauty math has similar to art and 
							music. The philosophy of math lies deep within the practice rather than the 
							outcome. Most other fields' true elegance is contained in the finished product, 
							a six voice fugue, an impressionist landscape, a flying machine that actually 
							flies. The study of mathematics appreciates finding connections. Somehow linking 
							these two seemingly unrelated ideas is a victory in this realm.
