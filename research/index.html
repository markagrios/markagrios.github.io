	<div class="topic">Sheaves &mdash;</div>
	<div class="content">
		Recently, I've been fascinated by the mathematical structures called sheaves. Originating in algebraic geometry, sheaves are incredibly
		powerful tools that can connect seemingly distant ideas in beautiful ways. Their ability to fit into so many mathematical concepts comes
		at the cost of being very abstract and hard to pin down. Just look at <a class="link" href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sheaf">the
		mathematical definition of a sheaf</a>. It makes like no sense unless you already know what a sheaf is. In short, a sheaf is a tool that
		allows us to look at something at a very small resolution and stitch together our "local" observations to construct a "global" understanding
		of the object in question.	</div>

	<div class="topic">Stimulus Coding in Retinal Ganglion Cells &mdash;</div>
	<div class="content">
  	Currently, I'm working on modeling two different types of cells in the mouse retina and trying to understand why they exhibit
		the behavior they do. Suppressed-by-contrast cells are ganglion cells that burst fairly regularly and then turn off when the
		eye detects a change in luminance (contrast). The other type, off-sustained-alpha cells, tonically spike and then turn off when
		presented with contrast, these cells are also particularly sensitive so they are good at detecting small changes in luminance.
		My project is trying to determine why the retina has two different types of cells that respond to the same stimulus, contrast, and
		why they exhibit different behavior, bursting versus spiking.
		<br>
		<br>
		We think that these cells encode different features of the same stimulus. Suppressed-by-contrast cells we think encode
		<i>when</i> the stimulus  appears (timing) and the off-sustained-alpha cells encode <i>how much</i> contrast there is (magnitude).
		So we are working on creating a model that simulates the different behaviors of these two neurons and testing whether different
		spiking patterns better encode different features of contrast.
